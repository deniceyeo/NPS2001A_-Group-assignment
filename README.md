# NPS2001A_-Group-assignment_Automated Recycling Bin
The purpose of this project is to create a prototype that addresses our identified issue of poor recycling rates among Singaporeans.
## Needed data
Our recycling bin employs at least 3 image classifier and sorting algorithm when sorting the object that enters the bin. We tapped on either existing algorithms or databases that we'll feed into the machine learning model to sort the object. 

### First level: Sorting Recyclable from Non-Recyclable
For the bin to classify recyclables from non-recyclables, we'll utilise existing algorithms and databases such as [RecycleSorter] (https://github.com/iancheung0202/RecycleSorter) and a dynamic database - [Google Drive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ajtfqsc5DEYgkiVz43b6S38CAW67r2VX?usp=sharing) created by the team to compile images of Recyclables and Non-recyclables. 

### Second level:
